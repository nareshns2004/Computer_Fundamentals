# UNIX Shell Implementation

## 1) Shell

A Shell provides you with a CLI (Command Line Interface) interface. It
gathers input from you and executes programs based on that input. When
a program finishes executing, it displays that program's output.
Shell is an environment in which we can run our commands, programs, and
shell scripts. There are different flavors of a shell, just as there are different
flavors of operating systems. Each flavor of shell has its own set of
recognized commands and functions.

## 2) Working of Shell

Shell reads your input after you press Enter. It determines the command
you want executed by looking at the first word of your input. A word is an
unbroken set of characters. Spaces and tabs separate words.

## 3) Examples of Shell

There are many shells available in different operating systems.
Few of them are given below

* Linux Shell
* Command Prompt
* PowerShell
* The Bourne Sell for Solaris

The Shell that we have implemented is basically a simples shell, which works
very similer to the shell tha we use in th ubuntu operating system

## 4) How to Run

In Order to Run This Project. Just Open Linux Terminal In Same Folder and Type

```c
gcc Shell.c
```
and Press Enter and Type
```c
./a.out
```

## 5) Basic Layout of Shell

The commands that we have implemented in this shell are given below

* help
* man
* leave
* pwd 
* whoami
* echo
* color
* bgcolor
* crdir
* deldir
* cd
* ls
* ls –all
